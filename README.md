## More About this project


 The app is built using Socket.io, which is a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between web clients and servers. Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime environment, is also used to create a server that handles client requests and manages the chat rooms. The app allows users to create rooms and join existing rooms, and all messages sent within the room are broadcasted to all the users in the room. This project provides a seamless chat experience, allowing multiple users to interact with each other in real-time within the same room.




## More about Socket.io

Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. The library consists of two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js. Socket.IO uses WebSockets when available, and has fallback options for older browsers that do not support WebSockets.
